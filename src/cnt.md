# Carbon nanotubes

Because the eNanoMapper ontology [<cite>Q27062683</cite>] is loaded, we can take advantage of the
hierarchy of the ontology. For example, we can list all <topic>carbon nanotubes</topic>'s (npo:NPO_606)
with this SPARQL:

<sparql>allCNTs</sparql>

This gives us this list of carbon nanotubes:

<out>allCNTs</out>

## Causal relationships

We can list all relationships for all carbon nanotubes:

<sparql>allCNTRelationships</sparql>

Which gives:

<out>allCNTRelationships</out>

## Carbon nanotube datasets

All data for carbon nanotubes can be listed with (depending on the amount of annotation):

<sparql>allCNTData</sparql>

This gives:

<out>allCNTData</out>
