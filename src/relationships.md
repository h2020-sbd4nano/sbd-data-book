# Causal relationships

Causal relationships links <topic>causes and effects</topic>. We can categorize them
by, for example, nanomaterial they are applicable too, by cause, and by effect.
The current open data includes causal relationship from the <topic>AOP-Wiki</topic> [<cite>Q111081275</cite>],
but still excludes the relationships from another paper [<cite>Q125744507</cite>]
and SbD4Nano Deliverable D6.3.

## Relationships for nanomaterials

<sparql>relationshipsByMaterial</sparql>

This gives us:

<out>relationshipsByMaterial</out>

## Relationships by cause

<sparql>relationshipsByCause</sparql>

This gives us:

<out limit="25">relationshipsByCause</out>

## Relationships by outcome

<sparql>relationshipsByOutcome</sparql>

This gives us:

<out limit="25">relationshipsByOutcome</out>

Or by Gracious [<cite>Q111312606</cite>] term:

<out>relationshipsByGraciousTerm</out>

## All relationships

We can also list all relationships:

<sparql>allCausalRelationships</sparql>

This gives us:

<out limit="10">allCausalRelationships</out>
