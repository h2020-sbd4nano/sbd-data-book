This book provides a summary of the semantic landscape of data sources that support
the safe-by-design development of nanomaterials. The book is enriched with
SPARQL queries, written in the SPARQL query language. To learn more about this query
language, consider reading [SPARQLing Biology: a beginners course](https://bigcat-um.github.io/SPARQLTutorialBioSB2019/).
