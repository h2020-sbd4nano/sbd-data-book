# Silver nanoparticles

Another class of nanoforms of interest are the <topic>silver nanoparticles</topic> (npo:NPO_xxx):

<sparql>allAgNPs</sparql>

This gives us this list of Ag nanomaterials:

<out>allAgNPs</out>

## Causal relationships

We can list all relationships for all carbon nanotubes:

<sparql>allAgRelationships</sparql>

Which gives:

<out>allAgRelationships</out>

## AgNP datasets

All data for AgNPs can be listed with (depending on the amount of annotation):

<sparql>allAgData</sparql>

This gives:

<out>allAgData</out>
