# Titanium Oxide

Because the eNanoMapper ontology [<cite>Q27062683</cite>] is loaded, we can take advantage of the
hierarchy of the ontology. For example, we can list all <topic>titania</topic>'s (npo:NPO_1541)
with this SPARQL:

<sparql>allTitanias</sparql>

This gives us this list of nanomaerials:

<out>allTitanias</out>

This approach can be used to find datasets, models, causal relationships, etc applicable to a certain
nanomaterial or nanomaterial class. For example, we can list all relationships for all metal oxides:

<sparql>allMetalOxideRelationships</sparql>

This gives us:

<out>allMetalOxideRelationships</out>
