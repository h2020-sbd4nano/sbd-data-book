# General requirements

General features we have to track of assets:

* copyright information
* license information

These two follow DMP and FAIR practices, see for example [this presentation](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3661425).

* supported hazards
* supported hazard drivers

Specific assets will have additional requirements or specific more detailed information about the second two
requirements.
